> ### Note: Due to the large size of the M5 dataset (~58M records), the data preparation step is split into two notebooks. The first converts and samples the raw dataset (01_data_preparation.ipynb), while the second (02_data_preparation.ipynb) performs detailed preprocessing and feature engineering.

## 3. Data Pipeline <a id="data-pipeline"></a>

### Data Pipeline

#### M5 Forecasting Dataset

The project leverages the **M5 Competition dataset** from Walmart—one of the most comprehensive, hierarchical time-series datasets in the supply chain domain—ideal for modeling **intermittent and lumpy demand**.

While the dataset does not natively include spare parts as products, the demand behavior of the items closely mimics that of spare parts. This makes it a highly suitable proxy for spare parts inventory modeling. The product names can be restructured or relabeled to reflect a spare parts context, allowing direct applicability of the framework to aftermarket and service parts supply chains.

#### Dataset Access

- **Primary Source**: [Kaggle M5 Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/m5-forecasting-accuracy)
- **Mirror**: [Nixtla M5 Dataset](https://github.com/Nixtla/m5-forecasting-data)
- **Alternative**: [Zenodo M5 Repository](https://zenodo.org/record/3713294)

---

####  Advanced Feature Engineering

#####  Calendar Features (27 Variables)

- `event_in_3days`, `event_in_7_days` — *Event anticipation signals*
- `snap_CA/TX/WI` — *Regional SNAP benefit indicators*
- `is_working_day`, `payday`, `month_end` — *Economic cycle drivers*
- `season`, `quarter`, `week_of_month` — *Seasonal trend decomposition*

---

####  Demand Classification (ADI-CV² Framework)

- **ADI (Average Demand Interval)**:  
  $$ADI = \frac{\text{Total Periods}}{\text{Non-zero Demand Periods}}$$

- **CV² (Squared Coefficient of Variation)**:  
  $$CV^2 = \left( \frac{\sigma}{\mu} \right)^2$$


| Pattern       | ADI     | CV²     | Recommended Models           |
|---------------|---------|---------|------------------------------|
| **Smooth**     | < 1.32  | < 0.49  | ETS, SARIMAX                 |
| **Erratic**    | < 1.32  | ≥ 0.49  | Prophet, Event-driven        |
| **Intermittent** | ≥ 1.32 | < 0.49  | Croston, TSB                 |
| **Lumpy**      | ≥ 1.32 | ≥ 0.49  | TSB, Modified Croston        |


## 4. Forecasting Engine <a id="forecasting-engine"></a>

### Forecasting Engine

#### Multi-Model Architecture  
The forecasting system employs a **sophisticated ensemble approach** with 6 specialized algorithms, each optimized for distinct demand patterns typically observed in spare parts management—ranging from smooth to highly intermittent.

#### Model Portfolio

| Model     | Use Case                          | Strengths                              | Implementation                      |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **TSB**   | Highly intermittent, obsolescence-prone | State-space modeling for intermittent demand | `statsmodels` (custom implementation) |
| **Croston** | Zero-inflated demand series     | Separate size/interval estimation      | Classical method                    |
| **Prophet** | High-value, seasonal patterns   | Holiday effects, trend decomposition   | `fbprophet` with custom regressors  |
| **SARIMAX** | Event-driven, promotional spikes | Handles exogenous variables            | `statsmodels.tsa.statespace`        |
| **ETS**   | Smooth, predictable demand        | Exponential smoothing family           | `statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters`       |
| **Ensemble** | Fallback for ambiguous patterns | Robust averaging of forecasts          | Weighted combination of all models  |

> This hybrid system is evaluated using a 3-tiered gating framework: statistical metrics (MAPE, MAE, RMSE), bias tolerance (±10%), and financial impact (cost-based ROI), ensuring selection of the **best-fit model per SKU-demand cluster**.
###  Evaluation Framework

####  Tier 1: Statistical Accuracy
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average of absolute forecast errors.
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Penalizes larger errors more heavily.
- **MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error)**: Scaled relative to naive seasonal forecast — **Primary metric**.
- **Bias**: Measures the average directional error; indicates under- or over-forecasting tendency.

#### Tier 2: Financial Impact
- **Holding Cost**: Cost incurred due to excess inventory from over-forecasting.
- **Stockout Cost**: Lost sales or service level hits due to under-forecasting.
- **Total Cost Impact**: Weighted sum of cost impacts by SKU unit cost and volume.

---

#### Performance Results
| Metric         | Value     | Interpretation                          |
|----------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| **MASE**       | 0.82      | Beats naive forecast by **18%**          |
| **Bias**       | 0.011     | Near-zero, indicates **balanced forecast** |
| **ROI Index**  | 3.56      | **39% uplift** in inventory ROI          |


## 5. Optimization Framework <a id="optimization-framework"></a>

### Mathematical Programming Strategy

The project implements a robust inventory optimization framework using **Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** to minimize the **Total Inventory Cost**, while ensuring service level guarantees and supply chain feasibility.

---

### Objective Function

Minimize total cost across all SKUs and locations:
$$
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Holding Cost} + \text{Ordering Cost} + \text{Stockout Cost}
$$

---

### Core Constraints

- **Service Level Constraints**:
  - Class A SKUs: ≥ 95%
  - Class B SKUs: ≥ 90%
  - Class C SKUs: ≥ 85%
  
- **Budget Limits**:
  - Region-specific maximum spend per period.

- **Lead Time Constraints**:
  - SKU availability must comply with regional sourcing delays.

- **Capacity Constraints**:
  - Max warehouse throughput and SKU storage limits by facility.

- **Reorder Constraints**:
  - Reorder only if projected demand exceeds reorder point over lead time.

---

### Solver Configuration

| Solver       | Primary Role              | Strengths                                                |
|--------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **IBM CPLEX**| Production optimization   | Industry-grade speed, presolvers, and solution fidelity   |
| **PuLP**     | Prototype + validation    | Lightweight, Python-native, interpretable                 |

---

### Dynamic Policy Generation

Based on ABC classification and historical demand variance, policies are dynamically generated per segment.

#### Inventory Policies by Segment

| Class          | Target Service Level | Safety Stock Formula             | Reordering Strategy     |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **A (High)**   | 99%                  | \( z = 2.33 \cdot \sigma \sqrt{LT} \) | Min-Max (s, S)           |
| **B (Medium)** | 95%                  | \( z = 1.96 \cdot \sigma \sqrt{LT} \) | Periodic Review (every T days) |
| **C (Low)**    | 90%                  | \( z = 1.28 \cdot \sigma \sqrt{LT} \) | EOQ (fixed order size)  |

---

### Regional Optimization Logic

Regional lead times and constraints are incorporated into the model to reflect realistic fulfillment dynamics and risk buffers.

| Region      | Base Lead Time | Risk Multiplier (Disruption) | Capacity Factor |
|-------------|----------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| **California** | 2.5 days       | 0.8 (critical buffer zone)   | 1.2× (overprovisioned) |
| **Texas**      | 3.0 days       | 1.0 (standard risk)          | 1.0× (baseline)        |
| **Wisconsin**  | 3.8 days       | 1.3 (remote distribution)    | 0.9× (capacity limited) |

- **Lead Time Adjustment**:  
  Effective Lead Time = Base Lead Time × Risk Multiplier

- **Capacity Bound**:  
  SKU stock levels × Volume ≤ Regional Capacity × Capacity Factor

---

### Results & Insights
- Achieved **cost reduction of 31%** over baseline replenishment strategy.
- Service levels remained above target thresholds in **98.7% of SKU-periods**.
- Optimization results fed into **AnyLogistix simulation** to validate feasibility under dynamic disruption.

## 6. Simulation & Validation<a id="simulation--validation"></a>

The simulation and validation phase uses **anyLogistix™** to stress-test the optimized inventory policies and network design, ensuring real-world viability. The goal is to verify that strategies derived from forecasting and optimization are not only theoretically sound, but also **resilient under operational volatility**.

---

###  Hybrid Modeling Approach

A mixed configuration ensures both scalability and control:

| Component                   | Approach                            | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Automated Data Generation  | Python-generated tables: `Products`, `Locations`, `Customers`, `Inventory Policies`, `BOM` | Ensures traceability and pipeline consistency from optimization phase  |
| Manual/GUI Configuration   | anyLogistix GUI with Excel templates | Enables scenario-specific flexibility for logistics objects like tariffs, vehicles, and shipping rules |

---

###  Experimental Design: Multi-Layered Evaluation

Several built-in experiments in anyLogistix™ were executed to evaluate system performance under varying operational conditions:

1. **Greenfield Analysis (GFA):**  
   Identifies ideal DC locations based on transportation cost minimization and service level constraints.

2. **Network Optimization (NO):**  
   Optimizes product flows, sourcing logic, and transportation modes across facilities, minimizing total cost-to-serve.

3. **Simulation & Risk Analysis:**  
   Dynamic simulation of the optimized network to assess behavior under real-world volatility:
   - Demand shocks (e.g., holiday surges, product recalls)
   - Transportation delays, capacity bottlenecks
   - Supplier failures and backorder propagation

---

###  Validated Performance Outcomes

| Metric                  | Validated Result       | Business Implication                                                   |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Service Level          | > 95%                  | High availability even under disruptions                              |
| Total Network Cost     | ↓ 22%                  | Cost-effective sourcing and stock placement                           |
| Stockouts / Backorders | ↓ 35%                  | Lower unmet demand due to robust safety stock policies                |
| Inventory Turnover     | 6× annually            | Leaner inventory with faster working capital rotation                 |

---

These results validate that the **integrated forecasting → optimization → simulation** pipeline can scale to 1000+ SKUs and deliver resilient, cost-efficient performance across geographies, product classes, and customer segments.

## 10. Usage Guide<a id="usage-guide"></a>

###  Usage Guide

The project follows a modular, multi-tool pipeline—from data preprocessing and forecasting, to optimization, simulation, and dashboarding. Below is the step-by-step execution guide.


####  Prerequisites

Ensure the following software is installed and configured:

- Python 3.11+ (Conda/Miniconda recommended)
- IBM CPLEX Optimization Studio (Academic/Commercial license)
- anyLogistix for supply chain simulation
- Microsoft Power BI Desktop

For detailed installation, refer to the `Installation & Setup` section in the main `README.md`.

---

####  End-to-End Workflow Execution

The project runs as a sequence of Jupyter Notebooks. Each step processes inputs and generates outputs for the next.

---

#####  Step 1: Data Preparation & Feature Engineering

```bash
#Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/vivasvana1/SparePartsInventory.git
cd SparePartsInventory
#Activate the environment:
conda activate spareparts
#Run notebooks sequentially in Jupyter Lab:
jupyter lab notebooks/01_data_preparation.ipynb
jupyter lab notebooks/02_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb
jupyter lab notebooks/03_optimization_framework.ipynb
```
**Notebook Descriptions:**

- `01_data_preparation.ipynb`: Cleans raw M5 data and transforms it from wide to long format.  
- `02_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`: Performs EDA, calculates ADI-CV² metrics, and runs ABC-XYZ classification.  
- `03_optimization_framework.ipynb`: Sets up inventory policy parameters and data structures for downstream optimization and simulation.
#### Step 2: Advanced Forecasting Engine

This step uses the prepared data to train the multi-model forecasting engine and generate demand predictions.

**Execute the Forecasting Notebook:**
```bash
`notebooks/04_demand_forecasting.ipynb`
```
 This is the core forecasting script. It applies the appropriate model (TSB, Croston, Prophet, etc.) to each SKU based on its demand classification, generates forecasts, and evaluates them against statistical and financial metrics.

**Expected Output:**  
A detailed CSV file (`final_forecast_df.csv` or similar) containing SKU-level forecasts, confidence intervals, model metadata, and accuracy metrics (MASE, Bias, etc.).

---

#### Step 3: Inventory Optimization

Using the forecasts, this phase calculates the optimal inventory policies (Reorder Points, Safety Stock, EOQ) by minimizing total costs.

**Run the Python Optimization Notebook:**
```bash
`notebooks/05_inventory_optimization.ipynb`
```
 This notebook uses the forecast data to formulate the optimization problem. It integrates dynamic lead times and calculates initial inventory policies using both Python-native libraries like PuLP and prepares data for CPLEX.

**Execute the CPLEX Models (Optional but Recommended):**

Navigate to the `Optimization_models_CPLEX/` directory.  
Use the IBM CPLEX Optimization Studio to open and run the `.mod` files with the corresponding `.dat` files generated by the previous notebook. This solves the mixed-integer linear programming problem to find the optimal inventory levels under budget and service level constraints.

**Expected Output:**  
A set of optimized inventory policy tables in the `/data` directory and detailed solution files from CPLEX. These tables specify the optimal reorder quantity and safety stock for each SKU at each location.

---

#### Step 4: Simulation and Validation in anyLogistix

This step validates the robustness of the optimized policies under real-world variability.

**Generate Simulation Tables:**
```bash
`notebooks/06_anylogistix_simuation_tables.ipynb`
```
 This notebook takes the optimized policies and other data to create the final set of tables required for import into anyLogistix.

**Run Simulation in anyLogistix:**

Open the anyLogistix software.  
Create a new project and import the CSV tables generated in the previous step.  
Use the imported data to run Greenfield Analysis (GFA), Network Optimization (NO), and dynamic simulation experiments to test the supply chain's performance against disruptions like demand spikes or shipping delays.

**Expected Output:**  
Simulation dashboards and reports within anyLogistix quantifying key metrics like service level, total network cost, stockouts, and inventory turnover under various scenarios.

---

#### Step 5: Visualization and Analysis in Power BI

The final step is to visualize the entire project's results in the interactive dashboards.

**Open the Power BI File:**

Navigate to the `Power-BI Dashboards/` directory and open the `SpareParts.pbix` file.

**Connect Data Sources:**

When prompted, connect the dashboard to the data files located in your local `/data` directory.

**Refresh and Analyze:**

Refresh the dashboards to pull in the latest data from your pipeline run.  
Use the interactive visuals in the Executive KPI Cockpit, SKU-Level Analytics, and Forecast Optimization dashboards to analyze performance, identify high-risk SKUs, and quantify the financial impact of your optimizations.

---

#### Customizing for Your Own Data

To adapt this framework for a different dataset, follow these steps:

- **Data Ingestion:** Modify `notebooks/01_data_preparation.ipynb` to load your specific sales/demand history and product master data. Ensure your data has columns for `date`, `sku`, `location`, and `demand_quantity`.

- **Feature Engineering:** Adjust calendar and event features to match your business or region.

- **Constraint Adjustment:** Modify business rules in `notebooks/05_inventory_optimization.ipynb` and the CPLEX `.mod` files to reflect your specific holding, ordering, and stockout costs, along with service level targets and budget constraints.

- **Network Modeling:** Update locations, lead times, and other network parameters in the anyLogistix input tables to match your physical supply chain.
